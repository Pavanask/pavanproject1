    <h2>Audio Amplifier </h2>
    <p>Amplifier is the generic term used to describe a circuit which produces and 
        increased version of its input signal. Early audio amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes 
        and some of these achieved high qualit Most modern audio amplifiers are based on solid 
        state devices ,but there are still some who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and the valve 
        sound. The classification of an amplifier depends upon the size of the signal, large or 
        small, its physical configuration and how it processes the input signal, that is the 
        relationship between input signal and current flowing in the load. Some important 
        applications include public address systems, theatrical and concert sound reinforcement, 
        and domestic sound systems.

          <h2>Windmill power generation using multi-generator and single rotor </h2>
          <p>For thousands of years, people have been using wind energy to do work
            from traveling around the world on sailboats to milling grain using windmills. 
            Today, wind is becoming more common as a renewable energy source through 
            the use of wind turbines.
        The wind energy is an environment-friendly and efficient source of renewable 
        energy. The kinetic energy of the wind can be used to do work. This energy is 
        harnessed by windmill in the past to do mechanical work. This is used for water 
        lifting pump and generating electricity. To generate the electricity, the rotary 
        motion of, the windmill is used to turn the turbine of the electric generator. The 
        output of single windmill is quite small and cannot be used for commercial 
        purposes. Therefore, a number of windmills are erected over a large area, which 
        is known as wind energy farm. The each and every windmill is coupled together 
        to get a electricity for commercial purposes. The windspeed should be higher 
        than 15 Km/hr.

        <h2>Distribution Storage Energy Management in Grid-Tied Micro-grid</h2>
        <p>Connecting a storage system (UPS) in parallel to both WG and PV systems is an effective 
            solution for supplying constant power to a system with a nonlinear load. In addition it will 
            minimize the dependency of utility grid and increases the use of RES in distribution side. 
            From the simulation results it is confirmed that the charging and discharging of UPS 
            during surplus/deficit power in test system minimizes the dependency of utility supply 
            and charges the UPS at zero cost during surplus power from RES sources.</p>
